[![WWW build](https://github.com/jthemphill/htmf/actions/workflows/www-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jthemphill/htmf/actions/workflows/www-build.yml)

## Simple webapp version of a deceptively simple children's game

You can play a productionized Webassembly version of the game at
https://jthemphill.github.io/htmf

## How to run in Webassembly mode

When running in Webassembly mode, the AI runs entirely locally on the client.
This is suitable for a "static" site like a Github page, where you're allowed to
ship HTML/CSS/JS to a client but aren't allowed to consume server resources.

You will need `pnpm` in order to install this game's packages and build this game's TypeScript.

To build automatically, download and run [hereby](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hereby):

```sh
pnpm install -g hereby
hereby dev
```

To build manually:

1. Go to `wasm`.
2. Run `wasm-pack build --target web` to build the WebAssembly.
3. Go to `www`.
4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the Vite devserver.
